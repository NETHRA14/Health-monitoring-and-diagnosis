Data Visualization Techniques
1. Univariate Visualizations  HISTOGRAM: Histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of data. The histogram is represented by a set of rectangles, adjacent to each other, where each bar represent a kind of data.  Bar graphs:Bar graphs are the pictorial representation of data (generally grouped), in the form of vertical or horizontal rectangular bars, where the length of bars are proportional to the measure of data. They are also known as bar charts.
2. Bivariate Visualizations
 Scatter Plots: Scatter plots are the graphs that present the relationship between two variables in a data-set. It represents data points on a two-dimensional plane or on a Cartesian system.
Box Plots: A box plot is a chart that shows data from a five-number summary including one of the measures of central tendency. It does not show the distribution in particular as much as a stem and leaf plot or histogram does.
3. Multivariate Visualizations
Pair Plots: A pair plot, also known as a scatterplot matrix, is a matrix of graphs that enables the visualization of the relationship between each pair of variables in a dataset. It combines both histogram and scatter plots, providing a unique overview of the dataset’s distributions and correlations.
4. Interactive Visualizations
 Interactive Scatter Plots: Providing tooltips or zooming functionality for enhanced exploration.
 Interactive Dashboards: Creating dynamic dashboards to allow users to interact with visualizations.
Assumed Scenario:

Real-time Monitoring Dashboard: Imagine a dashboard displaying real-time vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and oxygen saturation. Techniques like
line charts, gauges, and sparklines can be used to represent these continuous variables over time. Alerts and color coding can indicate abnormal readings, prompting immediate attention.

 Patient Health History Timeline: A timeline visualization can display a patient's health history, including past illnesses, treatments, surgeries, and medication adherence. Each event can be represented as a timeline bar, color-coded by type, with additional details available on interaction.

 Diagnostic Imaging: For diagnostic imaging such as MRI, CT scans, or X-rays, techniques like heatmaps, 3D rendering, and cross-sectional views can be employed to visualize anatomical structures, lesions, and abnormalities. Annotation tools allow clinicians to mark areas of interest or concern.

 Population Health Trends: Visualizing population health trends can aid in epidemiological analysis and resource allocation. Techniques like choropleth maps, heatmaps, and scatter plots can display geographic variations in disease prevalence, risk factors, and healthcare access.
